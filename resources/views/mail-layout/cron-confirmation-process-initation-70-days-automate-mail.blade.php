	Hi <strong>{{ $candidate_name }}</strong>,

	<br><br>

	Hope you are doing good!

	<br><br>

	You are due for confirmation, hence we would like to initiate your Confirmation Review Process. Through this, we wish to understand your journey so far. This is one of the biggest opportunities where you get to share your achievements, learnings, set backs, feedback & the master plan for the next year.

	<br><br>

	To accelerate the process, we request you to complete the following on priority:

	<br><br>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Fill Fresh Eye Journal: Share open feedback about your experience so far, feedback for teams, company etc. <a href="https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/RwRtTM" target="_blank">https://survey.zohopublic.com/zs/RwRtTM</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Share your Confirmation Review PPT (ROAD) with us on this email. The PPT should include the following slides:
			<ol type="a">
			  <li>Your JD (in your own words & not copy-pasted & rate yourself out of 5 on each point)</li>
			  <li>Highlights (achievements made during the probation period)</li>
			  <li>Lowlights (things that could not be achieved or didnâ€™t go as planned, during the probation period)</li>
			  <li>Plan of Action for FY {{ date('y') }}-{{ date('y', strtotime('+1 year')); }} (include all big-small ideas that you wish to discuss with management)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
